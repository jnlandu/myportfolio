        ## Introduction to Gaussian Processes
        
        Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a powerful and elegant approach to machine learning that provide a principled, practical, and probabilistic approach to learning in kernel machines. They define a distribution over functions which can be used for Bayesian regression, classification and other tasks.
        
        ## The Mathematics Behind Gaussian Processes
        
        At the heart of Gaussian Processes is the multivariate Gaussian distribution. A Gaussian Process is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution. A GP is completely specified by its mean function $m(x)$ and covariance function $k(x, x')$.
        
        \`\`\`python
        import numpy as np
        from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor
        from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import RBF
        
        # Define the kernel
        kernel = 1.0 * RBF(length_scale=1.0)
        
        # Create GP regressor
        gp = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=kernel, n_restarts_optimizer=10)
        
        # Generate sample data
        X = np.linspace(0, 5, 10).reshape(-1, 1)
        y = np.sin(X).ravel() + 0.1 * np.random.randn(10)
        
        # Fit the model
        gp.fit(X, y)
        \`\`\`
        
        ## Applications in Machine Learning
        
        Gaussian Processes are particularly useful for regression problems, optimization, and in active learning scenarios. They provide not just predictions but also uncertainty estimates, which is crucial in many applications.

        ## Implementation Example
        
        Here's how you might implement a simple GP regression in Python using scikit-learn:
        
        1. Choose an appropriate kernel
        2. Create a GP regressor
        3. Fit the model to your data
        4. Make predictions with uncertainty estimates

        \`\`\`r
        # Load necessary libraries
        library(fda)
        library(ggplot2)
        # Generate sample functional data
        set.seed(123)
        n <- 100
        t <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 100)
        y <- matrix(NA, nrow = n, ncol = length(t))
        for (i in 1:n) {
          y[i, ] <- sin(2 * pi * t + rnorm(1)) + rnorm(length(t), sd = 0.1)
        }
        # Create a functional data object
        fd <- Data2fd(t, y)
        # Perform FPCA
        pca <- pca.fd(fd, nharm = 2)
        # Plot the results
        plot(pca)
        \`\`\`

        np.random.seed(123)
        data = np.random.normal(loc=5, scale=2, size=100)
        # Define a Bayesian model
        with pm.Model() as model:
            mu = pm.Normal('mu', mu=0, sigma=10)
            sigma = pm.HalfNormal('sigma', sigma=1)
            likelihood = pm.Normal('y', mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=data)
            # Sample from the posterior
            trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=1000)
        # Plot the results
        pm.plot_trace(trace)
        pm.summary(trace)
        \`\`\`
